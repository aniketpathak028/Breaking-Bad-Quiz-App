## FAQ

#### Q1. How does is work?

Ans: So, every person has to answer 10 Questions, each with 
4 options and based on his/her score he/she will be judged
whether or not he/she is a true fan. 

#### Q2. I got same options in some questions?

Ans: Yeah, that can happen, as the options are generated randomly
hence, I cannot guarantee that all options will be different,
however, I am working to resolve this bug.

#### Q3. What API does this project use?
