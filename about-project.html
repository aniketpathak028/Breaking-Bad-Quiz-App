                                    Well, I was introduced to this amazing series of Breaking Bad in college, by my
                                    friends, and I
                                    decided to
                                    watch it during my summer break. I was completely fascinated,
                                    after finishing the entire series. Breaking Bad is by far the best web-series, I
                                    ever watched
                                    since, and as
                                    a Web Developer, I decided to build this application, out of my
                                    love for this epic series, and to promote it as well. If you haven't watched
                                    Breaking Bad yet,
                                    well I solely
                                    recommend you to do so, I bet you will like it as much as I did,
                                    if not more! Kudos!!
                                </p>

                                    This application uses the Breaking Bad API to fetch random quotes and characters and
                                    generate a question using it. It's an amazing API that lets you fetch any
                                    information
                                    regarding the show like character-details, quotes, actors/actress names etc.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thanks to the developers of this api, do check it out:
